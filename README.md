# Media Ranker

## Introduction

In this project, you will build a webapp where users can vote for their favorite pieces of media.

In contrast to previous projects, instead of implementing a pre-defined spec you will be imitating an existing site: http://media-ranker-2-0.herokuapp.com. Your job is to match the functionality and styling of this site as closely as possible.

This is an individual, [stage 2](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/pedagogy/blob/master/rule-of-three.md) project.

## Learning Goals

The purpose of this assignment is to reinforce the following concepts:

- Previous Rails learning, including MVC, RESTful routing, and the request cycle
- Testing Rails applications
- Building complex model logic, including custom validations and helper methods
- Using `session` and `flash` to track data between requests
- DRYing up Rails code
- Working with a CSS framework
- Styling a page based on an existing design

## Core Requirements

Regardless of how you choose to implement this project or how much of it gets done, you should

- Squeaky-clean git hygiene, including
  - A fresh branch for each new feature
  - Regular commits
  - Descriptive commit messages
- Fanatical devotion to test-driven development
  - Pseudocode first, then write the tests, then write code to make them pass
- Stalwart use of agile development practices
  - User stories should be listed and prioritized using a Trello board
